# Naive-Bayes-and-SVM-Predict
Using sklearn libary to implement Naive Bayes and SVM to train system and predict result for same data to check accuracy of Predection

Recomanded: use google colab to test code

If there any Problem let me know


Output
```
Predection percentage for yes =  37 %
Predection percentage for no =  63 %
Naive Bayes Accuracy Score =  76 %
Predection percentage for yes =  37 %
Predection percentage for no =  63 %
SVM Accuracy Score ->  79 %
```
